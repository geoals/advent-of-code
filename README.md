# Advent of Code 2021
## Usage
Input files are expected to exist in the root directory with specific names, ex. `day1.input` for day1, and day1sample.input for the sample input. The sample input is required to run tests.

`cargo run <day number>`

ex. `cargo run 1` to run the day 1 solution.

Run tests with `cargo test`
